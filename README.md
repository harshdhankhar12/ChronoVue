#  **ChronoVue — AI Career Timeline & Skill Prediction Platform**

ChronoVue is an AI-powered career prediction and timeline management platform designed to help users plan, track, and optimize their learning or career journey using smart analytics and real-time insights.

Instead of managing random notes, goals, and tasks across multiple tools, ChronoVue gives you a **visual timeline** of your progress — powered by **AI insights, career predictions, market skill analysis, and personalized recommendations**.

---

##  **Core Concept**

ChronoVue helps you answer the most important questions in your career:

* **Where am I right now?**
* **When will I be job-ready?**
* **What skills am I missing?**
* **What should I learn next?**
* **How does the market value my skills?**
* **What’s the most efficient path to my goal?**

Think of ChronoVue as **Google Maps for your career** — showing your current skill level, destination, and the optimal route to reach your dream job.
